                      HWGUI - Harbour GUI library

   1) Windows

   Installation procedure is very simple.

   There are few bat files to build HwGUI with C compiler of your choice:

   make_b32.bat  - Borland C
   make_pc.bat   - Pelles C
   make_vc.bat   - Microsoft Visual C
   make_w32.bat  - Open Watcom C
   makemngw.bat  - Mingw

   You need to set the environment variable HB_PATH, which must contain a path
   to your Harbour directory. This can be done in your Windows environment or
   by adding a line to appropriate bat file:

      SET HB_PATH=c:\harbour

   Then run the selected bat file and you'll get hwgui.lib, hwguimt.lib ( hwgui.lib for
   multithread mode ),  procmisc.lib, hbxml.lib and hwgdebug.lib in lib/ directory.

   With Harbour you can also build libraries, using Hbmk2 utility, just write:

      hbmk2 hwgui.hbp procmisc.hbp hbxml.hbp hwgdebug.hbp

   In contrib/ directory you'll find similar .bat and .hbp files for hwg_qhtm, hbactivex
   and hwg_extctrl libraries.

       To build samples you need to run appropriate .bat files, fixing environment
   variables there.
       Bld.bat should be executed with prg file name as a parameter:

   bld a

   2) Linux

   	Sources for the Linux GTK version are located in the source/gtk/ directory. 
   There is a shell file build.sh, which is intended for building HwGUI Linux 
   libraries. The environment variable HB_ROOT is set there, based on the 
   assumption, that HwGUI directory is within the Harbour directory. If no,
   you need to write the correct path to your Harbour directory, for example:

      export HB_ROOT=/home/me/harbour

        Then just run the build.sh and four libraries must appear in the lib/ directory:

      libhbxml.a
      libhwgui.a
      libhwgdebug.a
      libprocmisc.a

   You will find few samples in samples/gtk_samples directory and a shell file build.sh.
   The environment variable HB_ROOT is set there, based on the assumption, that
   HwGUI directory is within the Harbour directory. If no, you need to write the
   correct path to your Harbour directory.
